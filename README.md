   BDD Framework Development:
        Developed a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework using Java, Selenium, and Cucumber for automating tests on an e-commerce web application.
        
    • Testing Environment Configuration:
        ◦ Configured testing environments efficiently using YAML files, ensuring seamless execution of tests on a headless Chrome Browser.
    • Logging and Tracking:
        ◦ Implemented log4J to log and track test execution, providing comprehensive visibility into test progress and results.
    • Page Object Model (POM) Design Pattern:
        ◦ Utilized the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for clean organization and easy maintenance of test scripts.
        ◦ Implemented separate Java classes (POM classes) corresponding to specific web pages, allowing efficient interaction with associated WebElements.
    • POM Factory Implementation:
        ◦ Implemented the POMFactory class using a singleton design pattern for initializing POM classes.
        ◦ Ensured ease of object creation and initialization of necessary PageFactory elements.
    • Cucumber Integration:
        ◦ Integrated Cucumber to create feature files outlining scenarios and scenario outlines based on user stories.
        ◦ Developed step definition classes with JUnit for test case implementations specified in feature files.
    • Test Execution and Reporting:
        ◦ Utilized JUnit to run tests, generating detailed logs with validations at each test case.
        ◦ Employed cucumber reports to generate interactive charts illustrating test step outcomes.
        ◦ Captured screenshots during critical testing moments, enhancing data and feedback for testing teams and stakeholders.
    • Jenkins Pipeline Configuration:
        ◦ Configured a Jenkins pipeline for automated regression testing, triggered upon code changes in the GitHub repository.
    • Comprehensive Automation Testing:
        ◦ Applied the framework for end-to-end automation testing of an e-commerce application, covering user registration to product shipping.
    • API and Database Testing:
        ◦ Leveraged Postman and Karate frameworks for testing REST API endpoints, ensuring correct data transfer between front and back ends.
        ◦ Conducted SQL-based database testing to validate data integrity across the application.
